## Reflection
* What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?    
    * Getting started earlier, and also getting over personal issues that made it difficult to approach the project.

* Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?   
    * Difficulty was more of just imagining what site was to be imagined to fill the requirements of them.   
    * Made it overwhelming to start.   

* What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
    * Functioning timer and gameplay

* Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:   
    * Just think literally just one step at a time.   
    * Don't permaturely optimize your first solution
